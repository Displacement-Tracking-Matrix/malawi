### Methodology

The DTM drought assessment, supported by government partners and local stakeholders, targeted southern Malawi to identify districts (Admin2) and traditional authorities (Admin3) affected by drought-related displacement. Enumerators collected information about movements between November 2024 and 15 December 2024 through focus group discussions and key informants' interviews, focusing on the village headperson level (Admin4). These movements occurred since September 2023. The assessment focused on three types of movements: returnees, departures, and IDP arrivals.

Data was collected through onsite and online methods, depending on accessibility, using a mobile data collection form to ensure quality and integrity.

#### Definitions

**IDP Arrivals:** People that came to the traditional authority from another place in Malawi since September 2023 (Those that stayed or planning to stay for at least 3 months)

**Departures:** People that left this traditional authority for more than 3 months and have not yet returned (Since September 2023)

**IDP Returnee:** People that had left the traditional authority for at least 3 months, but returned (Since September 2023)

#### Coverage

Data was collected in 78 Traditional Authorities, in 10 Districts, in 1 Province.

#### Limitations

Data was collected through focus group discussions and key informant interviews, both in-person and online, which have inherent limitations:
- Results should be considered indicative rather than statistically representative
- Information is based on perceptions and estimates from community leaders and key informants
- Numbers reported are best estimates and should be interpreted as trends rather than exact figures
- Coverage may be limited in some areas due to accessibility constraints

444 locations reported [arrivals]{style="background-color: #F09362;"}; 388 locations reported [departures]{style="background-color: #F7CC69;"}; and 313 locations reported [returnees]{style="background-color: #94C8C4;"} (the maps will use the highlight colors.)

Map of assessed locations by movement type
:::

Of the 776 assessed locations, a combination of arrivals, departures and returnees (154 locations) was more common than any other combination.

Co-occurance of population types in assessed locations.

:::

Assessed locations with arrivals, departures and returns were most common, closely followed by assessed location without any of the three. The third-most common occurrance were locations with just arrivals.

Number of assessed locations and IDPS by settlement type

:::

The vast majority of assessed locations contained dispersed displacement rather than camps, informal settlements or collective centres.
